## Program Details ##
This console program will allow you to encrypt a file of your choosing using a basic encryption algorithm, as well as decrypt a file that has
been previously encrypted with this app. Please keep in mind while using this app, that you should not rely on it for
legitamate security purposes. As a demo program, it makes use of an encryption algorithm that is cracked very easily. At the same time,
I am able to create software that does make use of a more advanced encryption algorithm (and hence would be actual viable security solutions),
but I decided against that for this program, as it is not meant to help for that purpose, so that would just add unnessesary complexity.
However, when you do use it, legitamate security purposes or otherwise, please make sure that you do not use it to encrypt any files that
you need to be able to access quickly, because you will need to decrypt them before being able to use them again. This program will look in
it's own directory by default for a file to encrypt or decrypt. If none is found by the selected file name (or if the file that was found is
completely empty), the encryption/decryption process will fail, and an error message will appear on screen.

## Disclaimer ##

This program is a demo. While I am able to create software that actually has real world value, that is not what this one is for.
This program is strictly intended to serve as a way for me to showcase my skills as a software developer. Due to the fact how I am self-taught,
I am not able to provide any credentials/certifications that would need to be obtained from a third party, so I hope you will
accept this instead.
